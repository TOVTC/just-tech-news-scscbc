  Just Tech News is a full-stack web application that allows users to make, comment, and vote on community-generated posts. This application uses a model-view-controller framework to handle data. Users are able to create and login to personal accounts, create, edit, and delete posts + upvote and comment on posts. The application on the front end uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. On the backend, data is managed using MySQL and sequelize (passwords are protected using bcrypt). Node.js and Express.js handle API requests.
